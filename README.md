# pickledbeans
This repository is developing test utility for "Cucumber" test framework.

Our goals are developer will be able to test automatically by a few costs, and almost test category (e.g. UT, IT, ST) will be able to execute by just one framework (It's "Cucumber").

"pickledbeans" is Java Beans for map to steps in your scenarios are written by gherkin. These are structuring small clusters per test pattern and "Given", "When", "Then" keywords. So you will be able to test for your all or any products by low costs.

By the way, this project is used Japanese as main language because project leader is Japanese people. But we are welcoming to join by another languages. (I guess if I not could translate your language then google translation helps for us.) And Java is main programing language by the same reason, we're welcoming too.
